# G0-022M6-Pelican-Monster-Brain-for-GBC
The schematics, PCB, and flash dumps of two versions of the GBC Pelican Monster Brain.

Version 2.0 seems to only work with Pokemon Gold and Silver, and comes in a case with a gold BrainBoy sticker/logo.
Version 3.6 seems to work with every Gameboy Pokemon edition, and comes in a case with a purple Monster Brain sticker/logo.

All components labeled "Unknown" in the schematic were not present on the commercial PCB. Only their footprints existed.

The Colorizer button PCB wires solder to the inner two pads of the 4 at the rear top edge of the PCB.

Jumper configuration for normal operation: 

- J1: Pads 2 and 3 are shorted.
- J2: Open.
- J3: Shorted.
- J4: Shorted.

PCB Thickness: 0.8 mm
